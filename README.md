I used Ajax to do the HTTP request.

# First update

In the first update I changed the HTTP request to use fetch. Later on I changed it to use fetch with async and await.

# Second update

I updated the syntax to ES2015 in both the Ajax, fetch and Async with the purposes of writing less code and make it more readable. I also included callbacks and promises in order to make the code asynchronous.
